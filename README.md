# CSSE2002 Farm A1

CSSE2002 - Programming in the Large, was my first experience working with "large" codebases and code testing.

This first assignment focused mainly on learning and interacting with Java to implement and create a large CLI based
program. I was given a class diagram that specified required objects and functionality and my task was to build it.

This was an amazing assignment as it built my skills to be able to breakdown and understand implementation ideas of others.
Which I believe is quite an important skill.
